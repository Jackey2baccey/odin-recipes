        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets.</p>
        
        <p>Cooking a delectable lasagna begins with preheating the oven and preparing a baking dish. In a skillet, sauté finely chopped onions and garlic until fragrant, then add a mixture of ground beef and pork, cooking until browned. Stir in a vibrant tomato sauce, seasoned with basil, oregano, salt, and pepper, letting the flavors meld into a savory symphony. Simmer the sauce to perfection, allowing it to thicken and intensify in taste.</p>
        <p>As the sauce simmers, prepare a velvety béchamel sauce by melting butter, whisking in flour, and gradually adding warm milk until a smooth consistency is achieved. Layer the lasagna in the baking dish, starting with a generous spread of meat sauce, followed by lasagna noodles and a drizzle of béchamel. Repeat this process until the dish is filled, ensuring the top layer is adorned with an abundance of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Bake the assembled masterpiece until golden and bubbling, allowing the pasta to cook through and the cheese to achieve a delightful melt. Once out of the oven, let the lasagna rest briefly before slicing into portions, unveiling a piping-hot, flavorful delight that captures the essence of traditional Italian comfort cuisine.</p>
